Robot Azul

To run this script, install RTcmix on your machine, making sure to configure it with python, and run the following command from the Robot Azul directory:

PYCMIX < muscle.py

Note that PYCMIX is located at RTcmix/bin/PYCMIX after installing RTcmix, so unless you add that to your path you will have to be specific about PYCMIX's location. Instructions for installing RTcmix can be found at http://rtcmix.org.

This is a piece of music that I wrote for the final project in Dr. Sommerfeldt's class Computer Music Programming, in the Fall 2015 semester at the Crane School of Music at SUNY Potsdam. All of the notes you hear, except for the very last chord, are improvised by the script according to my algorithms. In the first of the two sections, all of the rhythms are improvised as well. All notes are selected from the blues scale (do me fa fi sol te do). In the first section, musical interest is created by gradually layering multiple improvising instruments whose improvisations gradually get more complex. This culminates in the finale when all instruments play together.

Looking back on my code, at time of writing this README (2016/08/05), I realize that it is very messy. I wrote it all in one very long, coffee-fueled, procrastination-frenzied session, and I absolutely do not vouch for its readability. However, it does work, so something must have gone right-ish. I plan to reuse some of the concepts I developed for interfacing with RTcmix and improvising algorithmically in a future project, which will hopefully be well-structured and readable, but I will not be cleaning up this project. This code stands as a generator for recording of Robot Azul and as a testament to the dangers of procrastination.

Check out my SoundCloud account (https://soundcloud.com/75saladin) for recordings of Robot Azul, just in case you don't feel like going through the headache of installing RTcmix. Each one is different, and listening to a few will show you what is definite and what is indefinite in this piece.
